There's a single tile a few feet in front of you that's marked the start. A voice comes out from an intercom somewhere. It's obvious that the speaker's voice has been changed with a voice changer of some sort.<br /><br />\"Watch your step, it's a trap. Most of the tiles in front of you will drop with the slightest bit of pressure. One misstep could mean instant death.\"<br /><br />Everyone looks at each other, scared to be the first to go.",

Safe. Lucky guess. Right step. Safe. Geez, you must really be lucky! Only two steps remain. Forward step. Safe. One more step! Forward? You take the step and almost make it to the door on the other side before the ground beneath you disappears. You scream as you fall into an endless pit of darkness.",

Safe. Only one more step to the door! Just as you start to think that you guys might make it after all, %DEAD% takes a final step to the right and the floor gives away underneath them. %DEAD% screams as they fall into an endless pit of darkness.<br /><br />While you stand in fear of meeting the same fate as %DEAD%, %REMAINING% wastes no time. They copy %DEAD%'s safe steps: left, left, right, and forward. At the final hurdle, they have a 50/50 chance of surviving. You hold your breath as %REMAINING% goes for it and takes a final step to the left...<br /><br />%REMAINING% is SAFE! You quickly follow their steps to make it to the other side: left, left, right, forward, left. Finally! There's no turning back now, as the floor disappears behind you. The next room will probably end things once and for all. You walk through the door."
