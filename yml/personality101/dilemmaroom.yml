conversations:
- - What do you think of this?
  - Would you look at that. Only the two of us remain.
  - We need to get out of here, but of course you already know that.
  - Let's both trust in each other and get out of here.
- - Where do you think we are?
  - Who knows. You think I would know?
  - Some windowless room, if you couldn't already tell. It's probably in the middle of nowhere.
- - What should we do?
  - Go look for clues like the dog you are.
  - Probably try asking the others. Or are you too incompetent to do that?
- - Why are we here?
  - I can only assume we're here to take part in some sort of wicked test of theirs, whoever they are.
  - We're probably here because something's wrong with all of us. How stupid.
- - How did we get here?
  - I was minding my own business getting to work one day when I felt a needle at the back of my neck. Lost consciousness and now I'm here.
  - Dunno about you, but someone stuck a needle in my neck and I blacked out. What is wrong with them, ugh...
- - Should I do this?
  - Sure, not like you need my permission.
  - No, your stupid self will probably get us all killed. So don't.
