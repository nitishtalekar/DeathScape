- - What do you think of this?
  - A blade, huh. They're really tasteless.
  - No way I'm dying here today. Anyway, let's start with the slips in the box and go from there.
  - Those dolls are gross. They look exactly like us, as if they were stalking us before all this.
- - Where do you think we are?
  - Somewhere private, I would say. But seeing how much they like to hide things from us, I don't think those cowards would tell us anything.
  - Probably in the middle of nowhere where no one will question why they're doing this lowly stuff.
- - What should we do?
  - We should get out of here, what else?
  - Ugh, what a pain. Maybe see what the others have to say.
- - Why are we here?
  - Seems like a social experiment of sorts...how scummy of them to kidnap us and trap everyone in this room.
  - Lab rats. That's what we are. That or they're trying to get some sick entertainment out of this.
- - How did we get here?
  - I went to sleep. When I woke up, I was here.
  - Hmph. Had the worst night of sleep, and it didn't help that I woke up just to see myself in this place.
- - Should I do this?
  - Sure. What, you scared?
  - No, you've gotta be stupid to even think about attempting it.
