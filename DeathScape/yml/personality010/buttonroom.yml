- - What do you think of this?
 - It's super interesting, but we've got to look around some more.
 - I think you need to look around more instead of standing around. Just kidding! Let's work hard to get out of here, okay?
 - We need to press the buttons in a specific way to move on. How about you do the honors?
- - Where do you think we are?
 - I don't know, where do YOU think we are? Kidding! We're probably in some run down place for all I know.
 - There's no windows around, so probably someone's playhouse? Who knows, haha.
- - What should we do?
 - Look around, duh! What else do you expect us to do?
 - Go talk to the others, duh! Gotta get as much info as possible.
- - Why are we here?
 - Not sure, buddy. Why do you think we're here?
 - Wanna bet it's because we're all criminals? I'm joking, obviously!
- - How did we get here?
 - No idea. I remember getting knocked out by some guy and waking up here.
 - They blindfolded me, those stupid people! Ahem, anyway, yeah, then I ended up here.
- - Should I do this?
 - Yeah sure, why not? There's nothing to lose.
 - No way, go look around some more before you do something reckless!
