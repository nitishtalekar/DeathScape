conversations:
- - I'm scared!
  - Guess I'll be leaving you behind then, have fun cowering!
  - Get it together you wimp! Gosh, such a baby...
- - Are you scared?
  - God no! I'm not a coward like you are.
  - I'm having a great time! Now get lost.
- - We're going to get out of here right?
  - I will, but you probably won't.
  - Yeah... I definitely will, might use you as a sacrifice though.
- - We're going to die down here!
  - Speak for yourself! I'm not a defeatist like you, I'll make it out of here just fine!
  - Maybe a wimp like you will, but I'm going to be just fine!
- - What's going to happen to us?
  - I'm going to escape, whatever happens to you isn't my problem.
  - There is no "us," I'm soloing this place while you guys tag along. Try and keep up.
- - Are we going to die too?
  - You might, I won't be dying down here.
  - Take your negative attitude somewhere else, I'm not interested in talking to you.
- - I don't want to keep going!
  - Then don't, stay here and die down here for all I care!
  - Quit if you want to, I'm going to keep going.
- - This place is creepy.
  - You would focus on the atmosphere instead of trying to get out here, huh?
  - Who cares, we should focus on getting out of here. Plenty of time to admire the scenery later.
- - We're going to make it out!
  - No thanks to you, I've been doing all the work.
  - In spite of the handicap that you guys have put on me, I have managed to drag you all out of here by myself!
- - We can do this!
  - You guys can go kumbaya over there, I don't need any of you to get this done.
  - Of course we can! I'm here!
- - I believe we will make it out of here!
  - Keep telling yourself that, if it's what you need to stay motivated and keep up with me.
  - I believe that I will make it out of here, I don't know about the rest of you.
- - I'll get us out of here!
  - Ha! A wimp like you? Don't make me laugh!
  - You mean I will get us out of here, you've been nothing but useless this whole time!
