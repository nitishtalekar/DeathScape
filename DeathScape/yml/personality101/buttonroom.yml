conversations: (mean, not angry, quiet)
- - What do you think of this?
 - Pretty dumb, to be honest.
 - We need to get out of here, of course. Or can you not think for yourself?
 - See those buttons? Maybe start there.
- - Where do you think we are?
 - Who knows. You think I would know?
 - Some windowless room, if you couldn't already tell. It's probably in the middle of nowhere.
- - What should we do?
 - Go look for clues like the dog you are.
 - Probably try asking the others. Or are you too incompetent to do that?
- - Why are we here?
 - I can only assume we're here to take part in some sort of wicked test of theirs, whoever they are.
 - We're probably here because something's wrong with all of us. How stupid.
- - How did we get here?
 - I was minding my own business getting to work one day when I felt a needle at the back of my neck. Lost consciousness and now I'm here.
 - Dunno about you, but someone stuck a needle in my neck and I blacked out. What is wrong with them, ugh...
- - Should I do this?
 - Sure, not like you need my permission.
 - No, your stupid self will probably get us all killed. So don't.
