- - What do you think of this?
  - It's eerie being in here, I'll give them that.
  - Interesting concept. It really does mimic a real scientist's workspace. The chemical samples look like the real deal, too.
  - I can hear dripping sounds echoing all over the place. Weird, since the room isn't completely empty.
- - Where do you think we are?
  - I think it's an isolated building in the middle of nowhere.
  - Judging by the windowless rooms, probably a room similar to a jail cell of sorts.
- - What should we do?
  - We should look around for now to see if there's any clues around.
  - We should ask the others if they have anything to share that would help us escape.
- - Why are we here?
  - Someone is probably out there trying to test us. For what reason? I don't know.
  - There must be something we have in common that brought us here. That's all I can guess for now, though.
- - How did we get here?
  - No idea. All I remember is getting knocked out all of a sudden, and the next thing I remember is waking up here.
  - I was blindfolded and drugged before blacking out, and next thing I know, I'm awake in an unfamiliar room.
- - Should I do this?
  - It's worth a try.
  - No, it's too risky. Look around some more before taking action.
