  - You're watching me lead us out of here, do I look scared to you?!

  - I'm going to escape, and that's all that matters.
- - We're going to die down here!
  - You're going to die down here, and the sooner the better!
  - I hope the rest of you die so I can focus on escaping myself.
- - What's going to happen to us?
  - You're going to get swallowed whole by this place, and I'll get to leave and go home.
  - I'm going to solve these puzzles, you can sit in the corner and continue to worry about what will happen.

  - In spite of how useless you've been, we will be getting out of here after all.

  - "We?!" Bold of you to assert that you've done anything to help us get out of here!
  - I've done this! You were just there, barely keeping up.
- - I believe we will make it out of here!
  - Keep on deluding yourself, you won't be making it out.
  - Your need to believe in the group is what makes you weak, while my belief in myself is what makes me strong.
- - I'll get us out of here!
  - Pfh, no you won't! You haven't done anything this whole time!
  - You've been riding my coattails the entire time, you haven't done anything of note.
