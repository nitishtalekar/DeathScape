As you start walking out of the room, you hear a splash from behind and notice that %DEAD% has been doused in an unknown liquid and lit on fire. You and the others watch, horrified, as the body burns away and a stench fills the air.<br /><br />Unable to watch any further, you all turn away and face forwards, leaving the door behind you to shut on its own as you enter the next room."
