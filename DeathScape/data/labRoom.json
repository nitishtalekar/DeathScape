There are rows of lab tables and cabinets on all four walls of the room. The room seems to be a science lab with scientific machinery and beakers of unknown liquids littered around the room. Typical lab tools such as Bunsen burners, test tubes, tweezers, etc. are present as well. Everyone goes off on their own to explore.",

You and the others watch, horrified, as the body burns away and a stench fills the air.<br /><br />Unable to watch any further, you all turn away and face forwards, leaving the door behind you to shut on its own as you enter the next room."
