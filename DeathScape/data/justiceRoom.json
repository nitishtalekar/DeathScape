  "name": "The Room of Justice",
  "description": "The room has worn-out walls and dimmed lighting. There is a guillotine in the center of the room along with a message scratched on the wall: Will justice be served? There is a box next to the guillotine saying to draw a slip with a number on it. There are four puppets in the room along the wall that mimic the appearances of the remaining people. Whoever is found guilty in the room has their puppet sent to the guillotine for their head to be chopped off. Lying is not allowed. At the end, whoever has lied the most gets killed by a hidden blade from the side that slices through their neck.",
